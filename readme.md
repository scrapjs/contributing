* If you don't want to maintain a project anymore
* If project is half-workable
* If you want to free npm name
* Transfer repo to _scrapjs_, transfer npm rights as `npm owner add scrapjs <package>`
* Claim any project you want (hope you are not a bot or whatever)
* Instead of writing "Project is abandoned", just put it here

## Ideas

* History and concept, idea of the project
* Author[s] and their story
* Transfer npm rights
* Give out package names for free
* What supressor or analog should we use instead

## Requirements

* The project is not gist or gibberish, it is workable to some extent
* Do not put stuff here if it has more than 200 downloads/month in npm
