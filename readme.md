# ScrapJS

The opposite of greenkeeper.

* If you don't want to maintain a project anymore.
* If project is half-workable.
* If you want to free npm name.
* Transfer repo to _scrapjs_.
* Transfer npm rights as `npm owner add dy <package>` or `npm owner add jamen` (will be transfered to scrapjs soon).
* Claim any project you want (hope you are not a bot or whatever) by posting an issue.
* Instead of writing "Project is abandoned", just put it here.
* Claim package name by posting an issue.
* Possibly indicate what replacement or analog should we use instead or the reason of abandonment.
* Time to live (optional, for countdown/auction in possible future).
* Join the org to help recycling stuff.

## Requirements

* The project is not gist or gibberish, it is workable to some extent.
* Do not put stuff here if it has more than 300 downloads/month in npm, accumulated by all dependent packages.
* Idea of the project should be clear from sort of readme.
* Should not be anonymous.
* TODO What is the policy for experiments?
* TODO What is the policy for websites?
* FIXME License should be transfered to public domain.
