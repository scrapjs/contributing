# ScrapJS

The opposite of greenkeeper.

* If you don't want to maintain a project anymore
* If project is half-workable
* If you want to free npm name
* Transfer repo to _scrapjs_, transfer npm rights as `npm owner add scrapjs <package>`
* Claim any project you want (hope you are not a bot or whatever)
* Instead of writing "Project is abandoned", just put it here
* Claim package name
* Mark what supressor or analog should we use instead
* Time to leave, like staging auctions or countdowns

## Requirements

* The project is not gist or gibberish, it is workable to some extent
* Do not put stuff here if it has more than 300 downloads/month in npm, accumulated by all dependent packages
* Some story/concept, idea of the project should be clear
* Should not be anonymous
* TODO What is the politics regarding experiments?
* TODO What is the politics regarding websites?
